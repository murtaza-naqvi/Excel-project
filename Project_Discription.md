## 🔍 Forecasting Techniques Implemented

### 1️⃣ Linear Forecast (First Method)
Uses Excel’s `FORECAST()` function or trendline projection to model a straight-line relationship between date and views. Suitable for data showing steady trends over time.

- 📊 Visualized using line charts with extended trendlines.
- ✅ Simple and interpretable.
